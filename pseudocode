listen to click event on every button
save the text value of that button in "val"

if val is a number or a fullstop then temp to += val. 
(if 2 numbers are put in val = 52 not 7)

grab the input field, display "temp" 

if val is AC:
  clear past entries (set list to nothing)
  set temp as a empty string
  set total to 0 
  display empty string in text field

if val is CE:
  set temp to empty string
  display empty string in text field

if its a multiply or divide symbol
  push the previous pushed button value to temp
  then push / or x
  then set temp to empty string so if its pushed twice it wont crash

if its =
  push temp (should be last pushed button) to entries list

  convert the first entry in entries to a number and store it 

  make a loop for entries
    get the next number entry: access i + 1 to get the number after a symbol 
    get the symbol (i)

    if symbol is +
      add nextnumbers value to nt (+=)

    if its x
      x nextnumbers value by nt (*=)

    //same for other symbols

    increment i????

  if nt is less then 0: add - symbol to it

  get text input field and set its value to nt
  clear entries and temp

  else: push temp and val to entries and set temp to '';
